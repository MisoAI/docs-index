Recommendation UI - multiple units
Sometimes you may want to display multiple recommendation blocks in a single page, or have different types of recommendation blocks across your site. You can achieve this by creating multiple recommendation workflows with different unit IDs.
For example, specify a unit ID in the <miso-recommendation> element:
<miso-recommendation unit-id="after-article-1">
<!-- ... -->
</miso-recommendation>
Then, you can access the workflow by the unit ID:
// note the plural form of `recommendations`
const workflow = client.ui.recommendations.get(unitId);
