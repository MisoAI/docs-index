Recommendation UI - data
Configure API request
You can configure the API and its payload (request body):
const workflow = client.ui.recommendation;
workflow.useApi(apiName, payload);
For example, to make the API return 8 products instead of the default value:
workflow.useApi('user_to_products', { rows: 8 });
Available apiName values are:
Value
API
"user_to_products"
User to Products
"product_to_products"
Product to Products
false
Disable built-in data source.
See the API reference pages for more payload options.
Configure API request globally
Since 1.8.2
You can configure the API payload for all workflows:
const context = client.ui.recommendations;
context.useApi(apiName, payload);
User data
To pass user data to the API, see API context.
