Search API - setup
Access Miso API with SDK client in a few steps:
Obtain your API key from Miso dashboard
Add Miso SDK to your webpage
Create a client instance
1. Obtain your API key
Log in Miso dashboard.
Select your enrivonment (e.g. Production).
You can find your publishable API key in the Overview section.
2. Add Miso SDK to your webpage
As a node module
In your project directory, run:
npm install --save @miso.ai/client-sdk
Then you can import MisoClient from the SDK:
import MisoClient from '@miso.ai/client-sdk';
// work with MisoClient
Using a script tag
Add the SDK script tag to your webpage:
<head>  <script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@miso.ai/client-sdk@latest/dist/umd/miso.min.js"></script></head>
You can put the script tag anywhere in the document.
MisoClient is available on window object. However, it won't be available until the SDK is loaded. The SDK provides a way to access it regardless of the loading status:
const misocmd = window.misocmd || (window.misocmd = []);
misocmd.push(() => {
const MisoClient = window.MisoClient;
// work with MisoClient
});
3. Create a client instance
Create a Miso client instance as the following:
const client = new MisoClient(`${apiKey}`);
