Search UI - data
Configure API request
You can configure the base API payload (request body) for the search workflow:
const workflow = client.ui.search;
workflow.useApi(payload);
For example, to make the API return 8 products instead of the default value:
workflow.useApi({ rows: 8 });
When user submit a keyword shiba, the API payload will be:
{
"q": "shiba",
"rows": 8
}
See the API reference for more payload options.
User data
To pass user data to the API, see API context.
