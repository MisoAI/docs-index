Examples
For example, suppose we call the API with the following response:
const response = await client.api.ask.relatedQuestions(payload);
// response
{
related_questions: [
'question_1',
'question_2',
'question_3'
],
...
}
And we want to track click events on the first two items from the related_questions property, then we send the following interaction:
client.api.interactions.upload({
type: 'click',
context: {
custom_context: {
api_group: 'ask',
api_name: 'related_questions',
property: 'related_questions',
items: ['question_1', 'question_2'],
},
},
});
