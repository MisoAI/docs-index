Ask module (combo) - configuration
You can configure the ask module with the some options, including:
Features
Phrases
API payload
Turn off auto-start
The combo element automatically starts the routine when the SDK is loaded. Thus, to configure the module in time, we want to disable the auto-start feature by setting autostart to false in the script URL:
<script async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@miso.ai/client-sdk@latest/dist/umd/miso.min.js?api_key=...&autostart=false"></script>
Access MisoClient
MisoClient, the entry point of the SDK is available on window object. However, it won't be available until the SDK is loaded. The SDK provides a way to access MisoClient regardless of the loading status:
const misocmd = window.misocmd || (window.misocmd = []);
misocmd.push(() => {
const MisoClient = window.MisoClient;
// work with MisoClient
});
Access the configuation method
Now you can access the configuration method:
const misocmd = window.misocmd || (window.misocmd = []);
misocmd.push(() => {
const MisoClient = window.MisoClient;
const combo = MisoClient.ui.combo.ask;
// pass the configuration options
combo.config({
//...
});
// manually start the routine, since we have disabled the auto-start
combo.start();
});
